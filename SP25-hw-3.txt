Homework 3 
1. Compare and contrast Flexbox and CSS grid, how are they alike and how are they different? 
Flexbox and CSS Grid are both CSS layout techniques, but they different in some ways. Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system and it is good for arranging items in a single row or column. CSS Grid, on the other hand, is a two-dimensional system that allows for more complex layouts involving both rows and columns. While both are powerful tools in CSS,  Flexbox is best for simpler layouts, and CSS Grid is better at creating intricate, responsive grid-based designs. 


2. What’s responsive design in web development and how do we implement it? 
Responsive design is about making sure websites look great on any device, whether it's a phone, tablet, or computer. It adjusts the layout and content to fit the screen size automatically. This is done by using flexible layouts, images, and media queries. Media queries allow us to apply different styles depending on the screen size, so the website adapts to look good on any device.


3. Create a HTML file with a flex container and three flex items. Give the flex items a color and width/height of 100px. For screens <500px wide have the items flow vertically and >= 500px flow horizontally. 
4. Create a form with bootstrap, should have a few input elements, labels, and a submit button.
